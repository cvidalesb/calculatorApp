# Railway Deployment Guide

## 🚀 **Your Backend is Ready for Railway!**

Your FastAPI backend is now configured for Railway deployment with all necessary files.

## 📁 **Deployment Files Created**

- ✅ **`Procfile`** - Tells Railway how to run your app
- ✅ **`runtime.txt`** - Specifies Python version
- ✅ **`requirements.txt`** - Lists all dependencies
- ✅ **`main.py`** - Updated for production (uses PORT environment variable)

## 🚂 **Deploy to Railway**

### **Option 1: Railway CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Deploy from your project directory
railway deploy
```

### **Option 2: GitHub Integration**
1. **Push your code to GitHub**
2. **Connect Railway to your GitHub repo**
3. **Railway will auto-deploy on every push**

### **Option 3: Direct Upload**
1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Create new project**
3. **Upload your project folder**

## 🔧 **Railway Configuration**

### **Environment Variables** (Optional)
Railway will automatically set:
- `PORT` - Railway assigns this automatically
- `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` - Set to "production"

### **Custom Domain** (Optional)
- Railway provides a free `.railway.app` domain
- You can add custom domains in Railway dashboard

## 📡 **After Deployment**

Your API will be available at:
- **API Base URL**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
- **Interactive Docs**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/docs`
- **Health Check**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/health`

## 🧪 **Test Your Deployed API**

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app-name.railway.app/health

# Test with mock authentication
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer admin_user" \
     https://your-app-name.railway.app/auth/me

# Test data endpoints
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer normal_user" \
     https://your-app-name.railway.app/data/
```

## 🔒 **Production Considerations**

### **CORS Configuration**
Currently set to allow all origins (`*`). For production, update in `main.py`:
```python
allow_origins=["https://your-frontend-domain.com"]
```

### **Mock Authentication**
- Currently uses mock authentication for development
- When ready, replace with real authentication system
- Mock users will work in production for testing

### **Database**
- Currently uses in-memory storage (data resets on restart)
- Consider adding a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for production

## 🎯 **What Works in Production**

- ✅ **All API endpoints** - Fully functional
- ✅ **Role-based access control** - All 4 user types
- ✅ **Mock authentication** - Ready for testing
- ✅ **Interactive documentation** - Available at `/docs`
- ✅ **Health monitoring** - Available at `/health`
- ✅ **CORS enabled** - Ready for frontend integration

## 🚀 **Ready to Deploy!**

Your backend is production-ready for Railway deployment. Just push to Railway and you'll have a live API! 🎉
